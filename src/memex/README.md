# CTRLxT OS Memex Integration

This directory contains components for integrating Memex technologies with CTRLxT OS, providing advanced search, semantic analysis, knowledge networking, and context-aware computing.

## Components

### /search
Advanced search and information retrieval components that leverage Memex's deep search capabilities.

### /semantic
Semantic analysis engine for understanding user intent and contextual meaning.

### /knowledge
Knowledge networking components that connect information across the system and combine with quantum entanglement principles.

### /context
Context-aware computing services that understand user context and provide relevant experiences.

## Integration with Quantum Components

The Memex integration is designed to work synergistically with quantum components, particularly the Quantum Entanglement Manager, to create a more interconnected and knowledge-rich computing environment.

## Use Cases

1. **Enhanced Information Access**: Advanced search capabilities that go beyond traditional file system searches.

2. **Intelligent Assistance**: Context-aware computing that understands user intent and provides relevant assistance.

3. **Knowledge Discovery**: Connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information to facilitate discovery.

4. **Semantic Understanding**: Deep understanding of content and context for more natural human-computer interaction.
