# CTRLxT OS Compatibility Layer

The compatibility layer provides interfaces for running applications from various operating systems on CTRLxT OS.

## Components

### /windows
Windows API compatibility layer for running Windows applications on CTRLxT OS.

### /macos
macOS/iOS API compatibility layer for running Apple applications on CTRLxT OS.

### /android
Android API compatibility layer for running Android applications on CTRLxT OS.

### /linux
Linux/POSIX compatibility layer for running Linux applications on CTRLxT OS.

## Implementation Approaches

1. **API Translation**: Direct translation of API calls from one operating system to CTRLxT OS equivalents.

2. **Containerization**: Containerized environments for running applications with their own runtime dependencies.

3. **Binary Translation**: Dynamic binary translation for executing non-native code.

4. **Kernel-level Compatibility**: Kernel-level support for foreign system calls and interfaces.

## Integration with Quantum Components

The compatibility layer can leverage quantum entanglement for improved performance in cross-platform applications, particularly for state synchronization and data sharing between different application environments.
