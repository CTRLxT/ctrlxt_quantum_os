# CTRLxT OS Unified Kernel

The unified kernel is the core of CTRLxT OS, providing fundamental operating system services and abstractions for multiple hardware architectures.

## Components

### /process
Process management, scheduling, and inter-process communication.

### /memory
Memory management, virtual memory, and memory protection.

### /file_system
File system implementations and abstractions.

### /io
Input/output subsystem for device interaction.

### /network
Network stack and communication protocols.

### /qep
Quantum Entanglement Primitives - low-level quantum entanglement services used by the kernel for distributed operations.

## Design Principles

1. **Multi-architecture Support**: The kernel supports x86, ARM, and eventually QPU architectures.

2. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be modular and replaceable.

3. **Quantum-Classical Integration**: The kernel integrates quantum computing principles with classical computing.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized for the 8GB RAM target, with efficient resource utilization.

5. **Security-first**: Security is a fundamental design consideration, not an afterthought.
