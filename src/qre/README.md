# CTRLxT OS Unified Quantum Reality Engine (QRE)

The Unified Quantum Reality Engine is a core component of CTRLxT OS that provides mixed reality interfaces, quantum-enhanced simulations, and multi-dimensional data visualization.

## Components

### /reality
Mixed reality interfaces that combine virtual and augmented reality with quantum computing principles.

### /simulation
Quantum-enhanced simulation framework for creating and interacting with complex simulations.

### /visualization
Multi-dimensional data visualization tools for representing complex data in intuitive ways.

### /interaction
User interaction models for navigating and manipulating quantum-enhanced reality spaces.

## Integration with Quantum and Memex Components

The QRE integrates with both the quantum components (particularly the Quantum Entanglement Manager) and Memex components (particularly the Knowledge Network) to create a rich, interconnected reality environment.

## Use Cases

1. **Immersive Computing**: Beyond traditional desktop interfaces to fully immersive computing environments.

2. **Scientific Visualization**: Complex scientific data visualization leveraging quantum computing principles.

3. **Multi-device Experiences**: Seamless experiences across multiple devices through quantum entanglement.

4. **Knowledge Visualization**: Visual representation of knowledge networks and relationships.
