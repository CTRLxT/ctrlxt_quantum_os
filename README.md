# CTRLxT OS: A Quantum-Entangled Operating System

## Overview

CTRLxT OS is a groundbreaking initiative to develop a new operating system that integrates quantum computing principles with classical computing paradigms. Our goal is to create a versatile, cross-platform OS that can run on a wide range of hardware, from embedded systems and mobile devices to traditional computers and, eventually, quantum computers.

## Core Technologies and Concepts

- **Quantum Entanglement**: The OS uses quantum entanglement to create a highly interconnected and distributed computing environment, improving inter-process communication, data sharing, and device synchronization.

- **Unified Kernel**: Built upon a unified kernel with support for multiple architectures (x86, ARM, etc.), enabling the OS to run on diverse hardware platforms.

- **Universal Compatibility**: Targeting compatibility with applications from various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS) through containerization, emulation, and other compatibility layers.

- **Quantum Computing Integration**: Designed to interface with and utilize Quantum Processing Units (QPUs).

- **8GB RAM Target**: Targeting 8GB of RAM as a baseline for optimal performance.
